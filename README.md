# osteo-RNA-Seq-Workflow
Workflow for estimating gene expression in osteosarcoma RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) samples

# Version Notes
- These analyses were carried out on the OHSU cluster computing system (Exacloud) using CentOS 7.7.1908 unless otherwise noted
- Exacloud uses the job scheduler, Slurm, for job submissions.  See separate files for Slurm submit scripts.
- Alignment of sequencing reads was accomplished using the STAR Aligner.  The version used was 2.7.6a
- GATK version 4.0.12.0 (Picard included)
- All Python scripts were run on Python version 2.7.13 unless otherwise noted.  

# Workflow
**Notes:**
- Each sample has it's own directory for output files.  Each individual directory is labeled by the "Sample ID"

**Step 1) Download the hg38 genome files:** The following files were downloaded from Ensembl on 12/9/2020 and were saved to a directory named "GRCh38.p13"
- Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.toplevel.fa.gz (ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-102/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/)
- Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.102.gtf.gz (ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-102/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/)

The Toplevel .fa file (Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.toplevel.fa.gz) contains all sequence regions flagged as toplevel in an Ensembl schema. This includes chromsomes, regions not assembled into chromosomes and N padded haplotype/patch regions.

The .gtf file (Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.102.gtf.gz): The associated README file does not explain all the different .gtf options so I chose the one that seemed consistent with the .fa file

Both files were then unzipped as follows:
```
gunzip Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.toplevel.fa.gz
gunzip Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.102.gtf.gz
```
**Step 2) Generate the STAR genome index files:** STAR run with the "GenomeGenerate" mode will take the user supplied reference geneome sequences (FASTA files) and annotations (GTF file) and generate genome indexes that are utilized in the mapping step.  The genome indexes are saved to disk and need only be generated once for each genome/annotation combination.
```
GENOME_DIR=<path to directory where you want the STAR index files to be saved>
FASTA=<>"/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.toplevel.fa"
GTF=<>"/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.102.gtf"
